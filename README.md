Solution to a coding assessment in Phython. 

The task was, given a URL to a google doc containing a table with 3 columns (x, y, character).
Recreate the secret message by parsing the data and arranging the characters in correct order based off their respective coordinates.

This is a single python file with 2 methods, I additionally used BeautifulSoup python library to aid in parsing the html data.
